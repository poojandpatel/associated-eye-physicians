    <h2> What Are the Different Types of Contacts? </h2>
    <p> 
    At Associated Eye Physicians, you’ll find a large variety of contact lenses to sample before you buy. Dr. Bertolucci and the experienced team understand that when it comes to contacts, it’s a very personal choice, and they want to help you find the best fit. Contacts lenses should correct your vision based on your individual prescription and also work well with your lifestyle, so the team offers different types of lenses for you to sample, such as:
    <ul>
      <li> Extended-wear</li>
      <li> Daily, weekly, or monthly disposables </li>
      <li> Toric lenses for patients with astigmatism </li>
      <li> Multifocals or bifocals </li> 
      <li> Rigid gas-permeable </li>
      <li> Spherical </li>
    </ul>
    Depending on your prescription, your eye health, and your lifestyle, Dr. Bertolucci and the team recommend soft lenses made from a water-containing plastic material called hydrogels, gas-permeable, or a hybrid lens. While most patients prefer hydrogel lenses, you can try out different types of lenses before you decide on the ones that work best for your particular needs.

    <h2> How Do I Choose the Best Eyeglasses for My Face? </h2>
    <p>
    It’s important to select glasses that look as good as they function, so you get optimal vision correction in a frame that complements your facial features and personal style. The team invites you to come in and browse their full line of designer frames for every budget at their optical shop. When you are trying on glasses, keep the following guidelines in mind:
    <ul>
      <li> Overall face shape: round, square, angular, or oval </li>
      <li> Skin tone and color </li>
      <li> Eye color </li>
      <li> Lifestyle; office wear or althletic </li> 
      <li> Prescription </li>
    </ul>
    You can probably tell for yourself when you try on frames, but some styles look better on one face shape and complexion than they do on others. The team at Associated Eye Physicians takes the time to help you find the eyeglass frames that work best with your features — ones that are in proportion with the size and shape of your face.
    <br> <br>
    Additionally, your prescription may influence the type of frame that works best for you. For example, if you need bifocals or progressive lenses, certain frame shapes can optimize your prescription. Your provider advises you and answers any questions you have to select the best frames and lenses.
