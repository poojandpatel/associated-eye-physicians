    <h2> What Are Cataracts? </h2>
    <p> 
    Cataracts occur when the normally clear lens in your eye becomes cloudy as a result of an abnormal buildup of tissue. It’s possible to develop different types of cataracts:
    <ul>
      <li> Nuclear cataracts that occur in the center of your lens</li>
      <li> Cortical cataracts the develop as wedge-shaped formations around the outside of your lens </li>
      <li> Subcapsular cataracts that form in the back of your lens</li>
      <li> Congenital cataracts are the result of a birth defect or genetic disorder </li> 
    </ul>
    In each case, cataracts typically begin very small and get larger over time. You may not even realize you have a cataract until it obscures your vision. Most cataracts are the result of aging or eye injuries that affect your lens.

  <h2> What Are the Symptoms of Cataracts? </h2>
  <p>
  Common signs that you may be developing cataracts in one or both eyes: 
  <ul>
    <li> Cloudy, blurry, or dim vision </li>
    <li> Difficulty seeing at night </li>
    <li> Double vision in one eye </li>
    <li> Colors that are less vibrant or seem to fade </li> 
    <li> Frequent changes in your eyeglasses or contact prescriptions </li>
    <li> Halos around lights </li>
    <li> Sensitivity to light and glare </li> 
    <li> Need for a bright light when you read </li>
  </ul>

    Cataracts distort the light that passes through the lenses in your eyes. As cataracts grow in size, especially if they’re located in the center of your lens, they affect your ability to see clearly.

    <h2> What Can I Expect From Cataract Surgery? </h2>
    <p>
    Cataract surgery is highly successful in restoring vision. After the procedure, many patients experience improved vision without relying on glasses. Dr. Bertolucci and team remove the clouded lens and replaces it with an intraocular lens (IOL). Advanced IOL options are available, allowing clear vision at different distances, eliminating the need for reading glasses.
