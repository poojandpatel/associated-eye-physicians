    <h2> What Causes Vision Loss? </h2>
    <p> 
    Unfortunately, as you get older, you increase your risk of visual impairments. In fact, over the age of 65, you have a one in four chance of developing some type of vision loss. Common causes of age-related vision loss include:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="/associated-eye-physicians/cataract/"> Cataracts </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="/associated-eye-physicians/diabetic-retinopathy/"> Diabetic Retinopathy </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="/associated-eye-physicians/glaucoma/"> Glaucoma </a></li>
      <li> <a href="/associated-eye-physicians/macular-degeneration/"> Macular Degeneration </a></li> 
      <li> Stroke </li>
      <li> Retinitis pigmentosa </li>
      <li> Detached retina </li>
      <li>Rental vein occlusion </li>
      <li>Optic neuritis </li>
    </ul>
    Vision loss from eye conditions often takes place slowly, so you may not notice any symptoms until your vision is dramatically affected. Dr. Bertolucci and team evaluates your overall eye health, taking into consideration any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, that could increase your chances of vision loss as you get older. Regular eye exams by an experienced, board-certified eye doctor are essential and often your best defense for preventing vision loss and managing symptoms.

    <h2> What Vision Loss Symptoms Should I Be Aware Of? </h2>
    <p>
   Some of the symptoms you should pay attention to before they lead to permanent loss of vision include:
    <ul>
        <li>Flashing lights and floaters</li>
        <li>Gray shadows in your vision</li>
        <li>Sudden vision loss in one eye</li>
        <li>Persistent eye pain</li>
        <li>Eye injuries</li>
        <li>Feeling like there's always something in your eye</li>
        <li>Blurry or distorted vision</li>
        <li>Persistent redness in one or both eyes</li>
        <li>Bleeding in the eye</li>
        <li>Decreased peripheral vision</li>
        <li>Trouble seeing at night</li>
        <li>Dark spots in your vision</li>
        <li>Faded colors</li>
        <li>Trouble seeing fine details</li>
    </ul>
    While each of these symptoms may not be cause for alarm, they may be signs that you’re developing a condition that could lead to vision loss, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration. Getting diagnosed and treated early can prevent permanent damage.

    <h2> What Causes Floaters? </h2>
    <p>
    Almost everyone sees floaters from time to time when tiny pieces of their eye’s vitreous (gel-like fluid) break loose in the back of their eye. The particles float around in the fluid, and you can see the shadows they cast on your retina as light passes through your eye. A few floaters every now and then isn’t cause for alarm, but if you see a shower of floaters and flashes of light, seek immediate care from your eye doctor.
    <br> <br>
    When a bunch of floaters suddenly appears, it could be a sign that the vitreous is pulling away from your retina, or that your retina itself has become detached. A detached retina can lead to significant vision loss if not treated promptly by a retina specialist like Dr. Bertolucci.
