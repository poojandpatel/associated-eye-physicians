    <h2> What Causes Glaucoma? </h2>
    <p> 
    Glaucoma is a progressive group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss. The exact cause is unknown, but it is associated with increased fluid pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure). There are different types of glaucoma, including:
    <ul>
        <li> Angle-closure glaucoma is the less common form of the disease and is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent blindness. Angle-closure glaucoma is the result of fluid build-up in your eye from a blockage in your eyeâ€™s drainage system. This type of glaucoma may develop over time or appear suddenly. </li>
        <li> Normal-tension glaucoma is the most puzzling form of the disease of all, as you maintain normal eye pressure but still incur damage to your optic nerve. </li>
        <li> Secondary glaucoma is the result of trauma, an eye injury, or another medical condition or eye abnormality. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What Treatments Are Available if I Develop Glaucoma? </h2>
    <p>
    If your doctor detects abnormal pressure in one or both of your eyes, the goal of treatment is to lower the pressure and maintain a healthy level. Glaucoma treatment options may include:
    <ul>
        <li> Eye drops to regulate the pressure in your eye </li>
        <li> Advanced laser procedures to drain fluid from your eye </li>
        <li> Conventional surgery, or trabeculectomy </li>
        <li> Implanted drainage tubes to help fluid flow from your eye and control pressure </li>
    </ul>
    The Associated Eye team provides the most effective and personalized treatment solutions for your type of Glaucoma and its effects on your vision. Treatment is typically lifelong to keep the disease from progressing.
