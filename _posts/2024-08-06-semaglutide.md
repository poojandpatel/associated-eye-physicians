title: "Risk of Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy in Patients Prescribed Semaglutide"
---

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE

- This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between semaglutide use and the risk of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in patients with type 2 diabetes or overweight/obesity. A significantly higher number of NAION events occurred in semaglutide cohorts than in non–GLP-1 receptor agonist antidiabetes cohorts across both populations with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity. The cumulative incidence of NAION over 36 months was also significantly higher in semaglutide cohorts. A Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a higher risk of NAION among patients receiving semaglutide.

- These findings suggest a potential risk of NAION associated with the use of semaglutide; however, further research is warranted to assess causality.-
