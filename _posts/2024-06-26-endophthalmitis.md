title: "Endophthalmitis After Anti-VEGF Intravitreal Injections With Aqueous Chlorhexidine vs Povidone–Iodine as Antiseptics"
---

TAKE-HOME MESSAGE

This retrospective study compared the rates and visual outcomes of post–intravitreal injection endophthalmitis in eyes pretreated with 5% povidone–iodine versus 0.05% chlorhexidine. Notably, there was no significant difference in endophthalmitis rate or visual outcomes between the two treatment groups. In addition, the use of prefilled syringes was associated with a significant reduction in endophthalmitis rate.
These findings provide clinically useful information on the potential factors contributing to the variable rates of post–intravitreal injection endophthalmitis.
